# Key Guard Program
it is a program written in  python, the main goal is to be able to get details from the user like website/app name, email associated with the website/app and add a password to it(can also be generated by the program) after that it is saved in a Json file where the user can either choose to view, delete or overwrite the data.


## Libraries and images credit
* [Customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) - Modern version of tkinter with more customization but also inherits main functions from tkinter.
* [CTKmessagebox](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkMessagebox) - Modern version of message pop up for customtkinter integration and homogenous ui.
* [Cryptography(Fernet)](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) - Library used for the encryption and decryption of the json file.
* [Pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) - Library used to copy generated password to clipboard.

for how it works





## Limitations
this program is a simple program and though the encryption process is good, its serves only this purpose for such simple program, thats why i used fernet, I might package the program later.
