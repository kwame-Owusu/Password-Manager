# Key Guard Program
it is a program written in  python, the main goal is to be able to get details from the user like website/app name, email associated with the website/app and add a password to it(can also be generated by the program) after that it is saved in a Json file where the user can either choose to view, delete or overwrite the data.


## Libraries and images credit
* [Customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) - Modern version of tkinter with more customization but also inherits main functions from tkinter.
* [CTKmessagebox](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkMessagebox) - Modern version of message pop up for customtkinter integration and homogenous ui.
* [Cryptography(Fernet)](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) - Library used for the encryption and decryption of the json file.
* [Pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) - Library used to copy generated password to clipboard.
* [Images credit](https://icons8.com/) - the images for the icons were taken from Icons8 website.

## Limitations
this program is a simple program and though the encryption process is good, its serves only this purpose for such simple programs, Fernet has limitations; because it is only ideal for data that easily fits in memory, and that is the reason I chose to use the json file format for storage of data. Fernet cannot be implement with large databases and large amounts of data at the same time, hence making it suitable for "local" small projects. 
One thing that could have been perfected would have been the addition of a login window before accessing the main window but because this is supposed to be an offline program, there was no need for that.
